Installation
================================================

Installing mlvern is straightforward using pip. You can install it directly from PyPI with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

For the latest development version, you can clone the repository from GitHub and install it using:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/mlvern/mlvern.git
    cd mlvern   
    pip install .

Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed, as mlvern requires it to function properly. You can verify your Python version by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   python --version
