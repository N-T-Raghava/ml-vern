Installation
--------------------------------------------------
Installing ``mlvern`` is straightforward using pip. You can install it directly from PyPI with the following command:

.. code-block:: python

   pip install mlvern

For the latest development version, you can clone the repository from GitHub and install it using:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/mlvern/mlvern.git
   cd mlvern   
   pip install .

Make sure you have ``Python 3.10 or higher installed``, as mlvern requires it to function properly. You can verify your Python version by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   python --version

Once installed, you can verify the installation by importing mlvern in a Python shell:

.. code-block:: python

   import mlvern
   print(mlvern.__version__)

You're now ready to start using mlvern for your machine learning projects! For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the :doc:`Quickstart Guide <quickstart>`_.
